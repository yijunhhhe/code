Let's take a look at looping through dictionaries.
<br>
In this task we give you 2 lists: name and alias
<br>
Make a dictionary; store name as the key and alias as the value. They are ordered correctly for you.
<br>
loop through a sorted version of that dictionary.
<br>
Print out the name, followed by a space, followed by a colon, followed by a space, then finally the alias.
