<h2><b>Javadoc</b></h2>
</CENTER>

<p>
Javadoc is a tool to help produce documentation of Java classes and
their methods, in the format that we see when viewing the Java API
documentation. It is a standard for documenting such things as the
author of the code, method parameters, and method return values.
<ul>
<li> It reads the comments in the program that are in Javadoc format
and produces HTML-based documentation on the Java classes it is given,
i.e. documentation that can be shown in a Web browser.
</li>
<li>It automatically links related classes (for example, other classes
that are used in declarations or parameters to methods)</li>
</ul>
For a complete description of the Javadoc tool, see
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html">here</a> . There is far too much detail there
for our purposes, but go to the link to Javadoc Reference Pages, and
read the section Documentation Comments for more details than are
given below.
</a>
</p>


<h3>Javadoc Comments</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>A Javadoc comment begins with the <code>/**</code> marker and ends with the <code>*/</code> marker, and encloses a description of the class or method.</li>
<li>A Javadoc comment must appear immediately before the declaration for any class, interface, constructor, method, or field that it is describing.</li>
<li>Make sure you put any import statements before the first Javadoc comment.</li>
<li>Class comments: should explain the purpose of the class and who wrote it.</li>
<li>Method comments: should give a brief description of the purpose of the method, what the parameters are, and what is returned. The purpose of the method should be one sentence (this goes into a summary table).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Javadoc Tags</h3>

<p>Javadoc tags are used within the comments, for documenting important aspects of a class or method. They must start at the beginning of a line. Here are the most common tags:    
<ul>
<li><b>@param</b> used to describe a parameter for a method (use a separate @param line for each parameter)</li>
<li><b>@return</b> used to describe the value returned from a method (used only when return type is not void)</li>
<li><b>@author</b> used to identify the author of the code</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
/**
 * This class represents a rectangular shape.
 * @author CS1027 Lecture Notes
 */
 
public class Rectangle {
 
/**
 * length of rectangle
 */
  private int length;
/**
 * width of rectangle
 */
  private int width;
 
/**
 * Constructor creates object with given length and width
 * @param len length of rectangle
 * @param wid width of rectangle
 */
  public Rectangle(int len, int wid) {
    length = len;
    width = wid;
  }
/**
 * Accessor method to get length of rectangle
 * @return length of rectangle
 */
  public int getLength() {
    return length;
  }
}
</pre>

<h3>HTML Tags</h3>

<p>Since Javadoc outputs HTML-based documentation, you can also put HTML tags within the comments, such as:
<pre>
&lt;b&gt;text to be bolded&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the beginning of a new paragraph
</pre>
Example:
<pre>
/**
 *  This is a &lt;b&gt;Javadoc&lt;/b&gt; comment.
 */
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Running Javadoc</h3>

<p>
In Eclipse, select Project, Generate Javadoc  to create the HTML documentation based on the Javadoc comments of all classes within the project.
This can be displayed in a browser such as Internet Explorer, with index.html as the starting point.
