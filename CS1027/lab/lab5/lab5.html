<h3>General lab instructions to help labs run smoothly</h3>
        <ul>
        <li> Read through the lab instructions <it> before </it> coming to the lab.
        <li> Do the pre-lab preparation.
        </ul>

<h3>Overview and preparation</h3>

<p>Upon completion of this lab, you should be able to understand how
nodes work in a linked list, using the <code>LinearNode</code> class
and understand the linked list implementation of the Stack ADT.</p>

<p>Pre-lab Preparation:
<ul>
<li>Review Topic 6: Make sure you understand how the class <code>LinearNode</code> represents a node of a linked list.</li>
<li>Review Topic 7: Make sure you understand what a stack looks like, when implemented as a linked list.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Exercise 1: Building a Linked List, revisited</h3>

<ul>
<li>Download the file <a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/courses/CS1027b/code/BuildLinkedList.java">BuildLinkedList.java</a> for
the <a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/courses/CS1027b/code-cs1027b.html">course webpage</a>. It contains a main method that builds a linked list of integers from 1 to 10. In order to run this program, you will also need to download LinearNode.java.</li>
<li>
Run the program and see what is printed out as the contents of the linked list.
</li>
<li>What would happen if you changed the first for loop to  <code>for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) </code>, and why?
If you are not sure, try making the change and see what happens.</li>
<li>
The code that traverses the linked list and displays each data item works specifically for (and only for) a linked list with exactly ten nodes. In order to make the code more general, we can use the fact that the last node always points to nothing, we can use a while loop that stops looping when the next field of the current node is null. Make this change to your code: change the for loop to a while loop that will work for any linked list. Run your BuildLinkedList program to make sure it still displays the contents of the linked list correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercise 2: Completing the LinkedStack class</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Download LinkedStack.java and fill in the missing code in the methods <code>isEmpty</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>toString</code>. (Note that the String representation returned by toString should contain all the items in the stack.)
The <code>isEmpty</code> and <code>size</code> methods are trivial; model your <code>toString</code> method on the code you wrote in Exercise 1,  using a loop to traverse the linked list. (The main difference is that you are forming a string rather than printing each data item.) 
</li>
<li>
Download all the files you will need in order to use LinkedStack.java
</li>
<li>
Download the code in the file <a href="TestLinkedStack.txt">TestLinkedStack.txt</a> and cut and paste this at the end of your <code>LinkedStack</code> class as a test harness (as explained in Lab 2). Run this as the <code>main</code> method, to show that your new methods in <code>LinkedStack</code> work correctly.
</li>
