<h3>General lab instructions to help labs run smoothly</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Read through the lab instructions <it> before </it> coming to the lab.
  <li> Do the pre-lab preparation.
</ul>


<h3>Overview and preparation</h3>

<p>
Upon completion of this lab, you should be able to understand the
linked list and circular array implementations of the Queue ADT.  For
prepation, review Topic 9 of the lecture notes (make sure you
understand what a queue looks like when implemented as a linked list,
as an array, and as a circular array).
</p>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Download <code>CircularArrayQueue.java</code> from the sample code
<a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/courses/CS1027b/code-cs1027b.html">page</a>
and fill in the missing code in the methods.  The code for the helper
method <code>expandCapacity</code> is given; note that it is different
from the <code>expandCapacity</code> of the regular array
implementations that we have seen for the Stack ADT and Queue ADT.
<ul>
<li><code>first</code> is similar to <code>dequeue</code>, but doesn't remove the element</li>
<li><code>isEmpty</code> and <code>size</code> are trivial</li>
<li>for <code>toString</code>, setting up the string is similar in
concept to the <code>toString</code> method
in <code>ArrayStack.java</code>, which was similar to the following:
<pre>
public String toString(){
  String result = "";
  for (int i=0; i < top; i++)
    result = result + stack[i].toString() + "\n";
  return result;
}
</pre>
Of course the attributes are no longer called stack and top, so you
need to change those. But, more importantly, you will not be starting
the array index at 0.  The counter for the loop can still go from 0
to <code>count</code>, since you will still go through the for loop as
many times as there are items in the queue. But the array index will
need to be a different variable, that starts at the value in the
attribute <code>front</code>. You will need to increment the array
index in the body of the for loop, taking into account that it may
need to wrap around to the beginning of the array again. It is the
same idea as how <code>rear</code> is incremented in the <code>enqueue</code> method, and how
<code>front</code> is incremented in the
provided <code>expandCapacity</code> method.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Download the given test driver <a href="TestCAQ.java">TestCAQ.java</a>
to test your implementation of the <code>CircularArrayQueue</code>
class. This test driver is provided as an example of a test program
that does thorough testing, in a way that displays whether or not the
test results are the expected results.
</li>
<li>
Answer the questions below before running TestCAQ on your circular
array queue implementation, to make sure you understand how it works.
<ake corrections in your <code>CircularArrayQueue.java</code> until
all the tests have been completed successfully.
<ul>
<li>
In the main method, what is the purpose of the second parameter in all
the calls to the testing methods, for example the first 3 calls:
<pre>
t_isEmpty(first, true);
t_size(first, 0);
t_toString(first, "");
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Is it possible to enqueue objects of different types to the queue first, for example:
<pre>
first.enqueue(new Integer());
first.enqueue(new Float(i*10));
</pre>
</li>
<li>
What is the type of the objects being enqueued in the following statements?
<pre>
first.enqueue("A");
first.enqueue("S");
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
