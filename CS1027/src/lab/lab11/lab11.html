<p>
Upon completion of this lab, you should be able to understand inorder
traversals of a Binary Search Tree and observe how Binary Search Trees
look when they are built in different ways.
</p>

<h3>Exercise 1 -  Traversing a Binary Search Tree in Descending Order</h3>

<p>
Recall that an inorder traversal of a Binary Tree does the (recursive)
traversal like this: traverse left subtree, visit root, traverse right
subtree. For a Binary Search Tree, this results in the tree items
being visited in ascending order. To visit the items in descending
order, we switch the left and right traversals in the recursive
algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Recall that the <code>LinkedBinaryTree</code> class has the method
<code>iteratorInOrder</code>. Let's call our method that does the
right,root,left variation of inorder traversal
<code>iteratorInOrderDescending</code>. There are many ways we could
add this method; for example, it could be added
to <code>LinkedBinaryTree.java</code>. However, since it is most
relevant to a Binary Search Tree, we could also add it to our
<code>LinkedBinarySearchTree</code> (which
extends <code>LinkedBinaryTree</code>). Or, we could add it to
<code>BinarySearchTreeList</code> (which
extends <code>LinkedBinarySearchTree</code>).  We will call this class
<code>IterableBinarySearchTreeList</code>, and you will implement the
following two methods (only) in that class:
<ul>
<li><code>public Iterator<T> iteratorInOrderDescending()</code>, which
returns an iterator which iterates over all elements in the tree in
descending order.  Hint: see the <code>iteratorInOrder</code> method
in <code>LinkedBinaryTree</code>. You can copy its code to this
method, and change it to use your <code>inorderDescending</code> method.
</li>
<li><code>private inorderDescending(BinaryTreeNode<T> node,
ArrayUnorderedList<T> tempList)</code>, which performs a recursive
inorder traversal in descending order.  Hint: this is nearly identical
to the <code>inorder</code> method
in <code>LinkedBinaryTree</code>. Here, instead of going left to
right, we want to go right to left.
</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Exercise 2 -  Creating a Balanced Binary Search Tree List</h3>

<p>
Download the files <a href="BuildBSTList.java">BuildBSTList.java</a>
and <a href="iteratorLevelOrder.txt">iteratorLevelOrder.txt</a> and
put the code of the <code>iteratorLevelOrder</code> method into your
<code>LinkedBinaryTree.java</code> from Lab 10 (this is the only
method you did not complete in Lab 10). Note that it requires the
<code>ArrayUnorderedList</code> class, etc., to compile; we provide 
most of them <a href=".">here</a>.</p>

<p>
<code>BuildBSTList.java</code> is an (incomplete) program that starts
with an <code>ArrayOrderedList</code> of integers from 1 to 10, and
builds a <code>BinarySearchTreeList</code> by just taking the items
from the ordered list (in order) and adding them to the binary search
tree. What do you expect that the binary search tree will look like?
This will be confirmed when you complete the program and run it; it
will show the created tree in level-order. The program then builds
another <code>BinarySearchTreeList</code> by calling a
method <code>buildBalanced</code> that uses an idea for building a
balanced tree: it creates an ordinary array that is the same size as
the <code>ArrayOrderedList</code>, copies the items
in <code>ArrayOrderedList</code> to this array, and then passes the
array to a recursive method we have called <code>buildBalancedRec</code> here. The
method <code>buildBalanced</code> is provided for you.</p>

<p>
Run your completed program and note the difference in the level-order
representation of the first tree created (by just adding the items in
order) and the second tree created (by adding the items so that the
tree is as balanced as possible). Draw a picture of the two trees from
the level-order representation, and show it to the TA.
