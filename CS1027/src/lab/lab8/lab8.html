<h3>General lab instructions to help labs run smoothly</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Read through the lab instructions <it> before </it> coming to the lab.
  <li> Do the pre-lab preparation.
</ul>

<p>Upon completion of this lab, you should be able to understand
recursive thinking in the solution of a simple problem.</p>


<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Upon completion of this lab, you should be able to understand the
use of an Ordered List, and how it compares objects in order to have
them inserted in the proper place in the Ordered List.</p>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Download <a href="ArrayList.java">ArrayList.java</a>. It is a completed version; the ArrayList.java on the Sample Code webpage is incomplete.
</li>
<li>Download all the other files needed to use <code>ArrayOrderedList.java</code> from the Topic 12 section of the
<a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/courses/CS1027b/code-cs1027b.html">sample code</a> link. There are 6 of them, besides the ArrayList.java you downloaded in step 1.
</li>
<li>
Download the file <a href="Phone.java">Phone.java</a>. The <code>Phone</code> class is a simple class that represents a telephone listing: 
the attributes are a name and a phone number.
</li>
<li>
Add to the <code>Phone</code> class a header such that it implements the <code>Comparable</code> interface. Make sure you are doing this correctly, by checking the specifications for the <code>Comparable</code> interface in the Java API.
</li>
<li>
Add a <code>compareTo</code> method to the <code>Phone</code> class, such that the <code>Phone</code> entries are compared  by name. Hint: you will need to use the <code>compareTo</code> method of the <code>String</code> class in your code.
</li>
<li>Check that your <code>Phone</code> class compiles.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Download the file <a href="PhoneTest.java">PhoneTest.java</a>. Its purpose is to create an ordered list of phone numbers that are important to you, from a file of names and phone numbers which you will supply (see step 3 of this exercise), and then print that list.
</li>
<li>
Download the file <a href="InStringFile.java">InStringFile.java</a> that is used for the file I/O. There is code provided in <code>PhoneTest.java</code> that looks after reading the filename from the keyboard and the data from the file.
</li>
<li>
Create a file of name and phone number pairs, such that each name is on a separate line and each phone number is on a separate line. For example, your phone list might look like this:
<pre>
Gates, Bill
888-888-8888
Hopper, Grace
123-456-7890
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The main method of <code>PhoneTest</code> already contains code to input a filename and to read a name/phone number pair from that file. You will add code in the appropriate places to:
<ul>
<li>Create a new Ordered List of <code>Phone</code> objects
</li>
<li>Store each name/phone number pair from your file in a <code>Phone</code> object
</li>
<li>Add each new <code>Phone</code> object to the Ordered List 
</li>
<li>When all of the information in the phone list file has been added to the Ordered List, print the Ordered List of phone numbers.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Run your completed <code>PhoneTest</code> with your file of phone numbers. The output should be your phone list in alphabetical order by names.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Exercise 3</h3>

<p>
You will now change the ordering of your phone list so that it is ordered by phone numbers rather than by names:
<ul>
<li>
Change the <code>compareTo</code> method of the <code>Phone</code> class such that <code>Phone</code> entries will be ordered by phone number. 
</li>
<li>
Run your <code>PhoneTest</code> with your changed <code>Phone</code> class. The output should be your phone list in order by phone numbers.
</li>
</ul>
