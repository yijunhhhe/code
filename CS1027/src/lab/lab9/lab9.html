<h3>General lab instructions to help labs run smoothly</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Read through the lab instructions <it> before </it> coming to the lab.
</ul>

<p>
Upon completion of this lab, you should be able to use an iterator to
step through the items in a collection from an application program or
within a class definition. In this lab you will be using your
PhoneTest.java from Lab 8. If you did not complete Lab 8, you can
still complete this Lab. You will need to download all the files that
were necessary for Lab 8 (see Lab 8 Exercise 0). You will also need to
create your own data file as described in Lab 8, Exercise 1, step 2.
</p>

<h3>Exercise 1: Using an interator in an application</h3>

<p>
In this lab you are using your file PhoneTest.java from 
<a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/courses/CS1027b/labs/lab8/lab8.html">Lab
8</a> (you can use the same project that you used in Lab 8). You will
add new code right after the code you inserted in Lab 8 to print the
ordered list, to step through the list using an iterator and print
part of the data in the ordered list.</p>

<p>
Observe that <code>phoneList</code> is of type <code>ArrayOrderedList<Phone></code>, 
and is declared and created in <code>PhoneTest.java</code> by
<pre>
ArrayOrderedList<Phone> phoneList = new ArrayOrderedList<Phone>();
</pre>
So, we can iterate through <code>phoneList</code> using the iterator method of the array implementation 
of the <code>ListADT</code>.  Note that you will need the file <code>ArrayIterator.java</code>.
<ul>
<li>
Add <code>import java.util.Iterator;</code> at the top of your <code>PhoneTest.java</code> 
(otherwise the compiler won't know to find the <code>Iterator</code> interface).
</li>
<li>
Add code, right after the code you wrote for Lab 8 that prints your ordered list of names and phone numbers, 
to iterate through your ordered list and print only the names (not the phone numbers). You will be using the 
iterator operation of the List ADT, i.e. the <code>iterator</code> method of <code>ArrayList</code>.
Hint see Topic 13 pages 17- 18.
</li>
<li>
Run your <code>PhoneTest.java</code> to check that your new code works correctly.
</li>
<li>
Now add code to iterate through your ordered list again and print only the phone numbers (not the names).
Hint: see Topic 13 page 18 again. Make sure you reset your <code>iter</code> variable (what happens if you donâ€™t)?
</li>
<li>
Run your <code>PhoneTest.java</code> to check that your new code works correctly.
</li>
<li>
Answer the following questions:
<ul>
<li>
What file(s) would you need to add to your project if you changed <code>phoneList</code> so that it was declared and created by
<pre>LinkedOrderedList<Phone> phoneList = new LinkedOrderedList<Phone>();</pre>
</li>
<li>
What would you then need to change in the code you wrote for steps 3 and 5?
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h3>Exercise 2: Using an iterator in a class definition</h3>

<p>
You will now write a different <code>toString</code> method for the <code>ArrayList</code> class: one that uses its iterator to step through the items in the list.
<ul>
<li>Add a new method called <code>toString2</code> (just to
differentiate it from the original <code>toString</code> method) to
<code>ArrayList.java</code>. It will have exactly the same functionality as
<code>toString</code>, i.e. it will return a <code>String</code>
representation of the list, but it will invoke
the <code>iterator()</code> method of <code>ArrayList</code> in order
to step through all the items in the list.  Hint: see Topic 13 page
19.
</li>
<li>Now add a line of code to your <code>PhoneTest.java</code> that prints your entire ordered list using the method <code>toString2</code>. Remember that <code>ArrayUnorderedList</code> extends <code>ArrayList</code>, so inherits its methods.
</li>
<li>
Run your <code>PhoneTest.java</code> to check that your <code>toString2</code> works correctly.
</li>
<li>Question: Consider the linked implementation of the </code>ListADT</code>, <code>LinkedList.java</code>. 
Would the exact same <code>toString2</code> method work in <code>LinkedList.java</code> too?
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Exercise 3: Add an iterator method to the Stack implementations</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Add an <code>iterator()</code> method to your <code>LinkedStack.java</code>. 
Hint: see Topic 13 page 15. Remember to add <code>import java.util.Iterator;</code> at the beginning of the file.
</li>
<li>
Lab 5 had code for a test harness for your <code>LinkedStack.java</code>. Add code to the test harness to test your <code>iterator</code> method, by iterating through the stack and printing the items in the stack. This is similar to what you did in Exercise 1 step 3. In what order are the items on the stack printed: top to bottom or bottom to top?
</li>
<li>
Add an iterator method to <code>ArrayStack.java</code>.  int: see Topic 13 page 14. Remember to add <code>import java.util.Iterator;</code> at the beginning of the file. Add a test harness to your <code>ArrayStack</code> class similar to the one you had for <code>LinkedStack</code> in step 2 of this exercise. In what order are the items on the stack printed: top to bottom or bottom to top?
</li>
<li>(optional)
The reason for the order in which the items are delivered is the way in which the <code>ArrayIterator</code> code goes through the array (i.e. starting at index 0). Write a new class <code>ArrayIterator2</code> that delivers the items in the array in the opposite order (i.e. starting at the index of the last item in the array).  Change the iterator method in your <code>ArrayStack.java</code> so that it uses <code>ArrayIterator2</code>.
Now test <code>ArrayStack</code> again with your test harness. In what order are the items on the stack printed now: top to bottom or bottom to top?
</li>
