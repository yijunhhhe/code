<h3>General lab instructions to help labs run smoothly</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Read through the lab instructions <it> before </it> coming to the lab.
  <li> Do the pre-lab preparation.
</ul>

<p>Upon completion of this lab, you should be able to understand
recursive thinking in the solution of a simple problem.</p>


<h3>Overview and preparation</h3>

<p>
Upon completion of this lab, you should be able to understand the
linked list and circular array implementations of the Queue ADT.  For
prepation, review Topic 9 of the lecture notes (make sure you
understand what a queue looks like when implemented as a linked list,
as an array, and as a circular array).
</p>

<h3>Exercise 0</h3>

<p>You should be able to answer the following questions correctly in order to be successful in Exercises 1 and 2.</p>
Consider the string defined by
<code>String sample = "CS 1027b";</code>
What would be returned by each of the following method calls?
<ul>
<li>sample.length()</li>
<li>sample.charAt(1)</li>
<li>sample.charAt(sample.length()-1)</li>
<li>sample.substring(0, 1)</li>
<li>sample.substring(0,sample.length())</li>
<li>sample.concat(sample)</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>
Download the file <a href="RecursionLab.java">RecursionLab.java</a>. Your task is to fill
in the code for a recursive method that prints a string backwards. For
example, for the parameter string "Java", your method would print
"avaJ".  The header of this method is <code>public static void
reversePrint(String inString)</code> Note that the method is static,
i.e. it is a class method, and will not be invoked on an object. (See
the <code>main</code> method to see how it is invoked.)
</p>

<p>Hints</p>
<ul>
<li>
Think about the problem of printing a string in reverse recursively by considering an example string, say "abcd".  To print it in reverse:
<ul>
<li>The first character to be printed would be the character "d" (which is the last character of the string). We are then left with the problem of printing a smaller string, "abc" in reverse. (Note that it's the same problem, only with a smaller string)</li>
<li>Print its last character, "c". We are then left with the problem of printing the smaller string "ab" in reverse.</li>
<li>Print its last character, "b". We are then left with the problem of printing the smaller string "a" in reverse.</li>
<li>Print its last character, "a". We are then left with the problem of printing the empty string in reverse. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Generalize that into an algorithm for the method <code>reversePrint</code>
<pre>
if the parameter string is empty (the base case)
  return from the method
else
  print the last character of the parameter string
  call reversePrint with the substring that does not include the last character as the parameter
</pre>
You can simplify it, by using the test <code>if the string is not empty ..</code>
You should be able to use just the <code>String</code> methods <code>charAt</code>, <code>substring</code> and <code>length</code>. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

<p>
  Now you will write a recursive method that returns the reverse of a string. For example, for the parameter string "Java"‚Äù, your method would return the string "avaJ". The header of your method should be <code>public static String reverseString(String inString)</code>
Add this method to the file <code>RecursiveLab.java</code>
</p>

<p>Hints</p>
<ul>
<li>
The algorithm should be 
<pre>
if the parameter string is empty (the base case) 
  return the null string as the result string
else  
  result string is the last character of the parameter string, concatenated with 
     the reverse of the substring that does not include the last character
  return the result string
</pre>
You should be able to use just the <code>String</code>
methods <code>charAt</code>, <code>substring</code>, <code>concat</code>
and <code>length</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Add the following code to the main method in RecursionLab.java to test your reverseString method:
<pre>
// test reverseString
String revString = reverseString(inString);
System.out.println(revString);
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Optional exercises (will not be marked)</h3>

<p>
Use the method <code>reverseString</code> in an application that
inputs a string from the user and reports whether or not it is a
palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the
same both forwards and backwards, for example mom, radar, racecar.</p>

<p>
Write a recursive method with the header
<code>public static boolean isPalindrome(String s)</code>
that returns <code>true</code> if the parameter string is a palindrome and <code>false</code> if it is not.
